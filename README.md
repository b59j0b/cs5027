Assessment Task 1: Individual Assignment 
(Weightage: 30%) 
based on 
MLO1: Propose an IoT-based system with an entrepreneurial mindset for a real-world problem. 
IoT-Based Smart Irrigation System for Urban Farming: 
An Entrepreneurial VentureProblem: Urban   farming   is   gaining   popularity,   but   inefficient   watering   practices   often   lead   to   water   waste,   nutrient   runoff,   and   suboptimal   yields.   Manual   watering   is   time-consuming   and inconsistent, while   traditional   irrigation   systems   are   often too   complex   and   expensive   for   small-   scale urban farms.
Proposed Solution: AnIoT-based smart irrigation system designed specifically for   urban farming,   targeting both individual hobbyists and community garden projects.
System Components: 
1. Moisture Sensors: Placed   in   the   soil   at   different   depths,   these   sensors   measure   the   soil   moisture content and transmit the data wirelessly.
2. Weather    Station: A      small,      localized      weather      station      collects      data      on      temperature,   humidity, rainfall, and sunlight intensity.
3. Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, Arduino): The brain   of the   system,   it receives   data   from   the sensors and weather station, processes it, and   controls the   irrigation   system.
4. Water Valves/Pumps: Electrically   controlled   valves   or   pumps   regulate   the   flow   of   water to the plants.
5. Cloud Platform. Data from the microcontroller is sent to a cloud   platform. (e.g., AWSIoT,   Google Cloud IoT Core, Thingspeak) for storage, visualization,   and   analysis.
6. Mobile Application: A user-friendly mobile   app   allows users   to   monitor   soil   conditions,   weather   data,   and   control   the   irrigation   system   remotely.   It   also   provides   customized   watering schedules based on plant type and environmental conditions.
7. Optional Features: 
• Nutrient Dosing: Integration with a nutrient dosing system to deliver precise amounts   of   fertilizer   along   with   the   water.
• Leak Detection: Sensors to detect leaks in the irrigation   system   and   alert the user.
• Integration with other Smart Home Systems: Compatibility with   existing   smart   home platforms for seamless control and   automation.
Entrepreneurial Aspects: 
Target Market: Urban   farmers   (individuals,   community   gardens, vertical   farms, rooftop   gardens), nurseries, and educational institutions.
Value Proposition: 
Water conservation through optimized irrigation.
Increased crop yields through consistent and precise watering.
Reduced manual labor and time savings for urban   farmers.
Remote   monitoring   and   control   of   the   irrigation   system.
Data-driven insights into soil conditions and plant health.
Business Model: 
Hardware   Sales:   Selling the   complete   smart   irrigation   system kit   (sensors,   microcontroller, valves, etc.).
Subscription      Service:    Offering    a      cloud-based      platform      with      advanced   features       (data       analytics,       customized         reports,       remote       support)       on       a   subscription basis.
Installation   and   Maintenance   Services:   Providing   professional   installation   and maintenance services for the   system.
Partnerships:      Collaborating    with    nurseries,       seed       suppliers,      and    urban   farming communities for distribution and marketing.
